# NP-CustomMap
This project is designed to allow you to create custom maps for your Neptune's Pride games. Currently it is a limited version of the menu in the game, but with these notable differences:
1) All home stars will have the standard default values as the game, but they will have warp gates.
2) Stars that are claimed from the begining will have radial symetry across players
3) Stars that start unclaimed are placed randomly.
4) Stars that start unclaimed will randomly have 5 economy, 2 industry, 1 science, a number of ships between 0-15, or a warp gate, with  a 5% chance of any of those occuring.
5) Resources among random stars will have an average value of 35 resources to start with.
Remember to create an issue for any customization options you want to see.
